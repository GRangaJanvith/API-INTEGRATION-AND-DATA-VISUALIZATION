Objective To demonstrate how to integrate a public API, process the fetched data, and create visualizations for meaningful insights.

Key Activities

    Setting up a Python environment for API integration and data visualization.
    Fetching 5-day weather forecast data using the OpenWeatherMap API.
    Parsing and extracting temperature and humidity data from the API response.
    Visualizing trends in temperature and humidity over time using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

Technologies Used

    Python: Programming language for API integration and data manipulation.
    Requests: Library for making HTTP requests to the OpenWeatherMap API.
    Matplotlib: Library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
    Seaborn: Statistical data visualization library built on Matplotlib.

Scope

    Fetch real-time weather data for any city.
    Visualize temperature and humidity trends over a 5-day period.
    Provide insights into weather patterns for specific locations.

Advantages

    Demonstrates real-world use of APIs for data fetching.
    Offers clear visual insights into weather trends.
    Easy to customize for other cities or parameters.

Disadvantages

    Limited to the functionality and data provided by the OpenWeatherMap API.
    Dependent on internet connectivity for data fetching.

Key Insights

    Visualization helps in identifying trends in weather data effectively.
    API integration streamlines the process of fetching and processing data.

Future Improvements

    Add more weather parameters like wind speed or precipitation.
    Develop a dashboard for interactive visualizations.
    Implement error handling for edge cases and API failures.
    Integrate with other APIs for a more comprehensive dataset.

Code Explanation

    API Integration:
        requests.get() is used to fetch weather data.
        The API key and city name are passed as parameters.
    Data Parsing:
        The JSON response is parsed to extract dates, temperatures, and humidity values.
    Visualization:
        Line plots are created for temperature and humidity trends using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
